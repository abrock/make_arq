# A command-line tool for generating Sony A7RIII Pixel-Shift (pseudo-)ARQ files #

This is a simple Python script to combine 4 source ARW files taken in Pixel Shift Multi Shooting mode with a Sony A7RIII camera and save the result as a pseudo-ARQ file, similarly to what Sony's Imaging Edge would do.
The generated file is a "pseudo-ARQ" in the sense that it will have the same data layout as proper ARQ files generated by Sony's Imaging Edge, but the metadata will be different. As such, the files will not be compatible with Sony's software. They can however be processed by RawTherapee.

Dependencies:

- Python (tested with 2.7);

- [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/), which must be in your $PATH`;

- [tifffile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tifffile)

- [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)


Example usage:

```text
$ python make_arq.py file1.ARW file2.ARW file3.ARW file4.ARW -o out.ARQ
```
